###Ello, PBC - Mobile Lead & VP Engineering
####December 2014 - Present

As Mobile lead I develop and oversee both of Ello's Android and iOS applications. Our mobile team has between 2 and 7 engineers depending on the greater engineering team's focus. We encourage engineers to work in all areas of the product. Most of my time is spent in Swift but a week of work may see commits written in Java, React.js, Rails, Go and Lua.

As VP Engineering I managed a team of 8 diverse engineers working on Ello's suite of roughly 20 applications and services working in concert to deliver millions of posts and interactions across Ello's network.
